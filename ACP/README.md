## Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)

### When to use ACP

If you want a local-first approach—BeeAI runs on your machine or private infrastructure.
If you need an easy way to spin up and orchestrate multiple agents, especially if they come from different frameworks and languages, behind a single platform.
If you value deep telemetry and traceability for agent interactions.

## Key Difference vs. A2A: 
While ACP can unify BeeAI’s internal multiagent environment, A2A is explicitly designed for bridging external agent frameworks and vendors.
