# Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs typically stand for Large Language Models. These are advanced natural language processing models that use deep learning techniques, particularly variants of the transformer architecture, to understand and generate human-like text. 
LLMs are capable of a wide range of language-related tasks, including language translation, text summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis, and more. Examples of LLMs include OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and Facebook's RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). 
These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to a variety of prompts.
