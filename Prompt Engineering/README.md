## Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts, which are questions or instructions, to draw out specific responses from generative AI models. This involves crafting the right questions or instructions to guide AI models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), to produce desired outcomes The process combines elements of logic, coding, art, and special modifiers, and the prompts can include natural language text, images, or other types of input data Prompt engineering is crucial for creating better AI-powered services and getting better results from existing generative AI tools
